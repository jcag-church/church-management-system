# Church Management System Showcase

## 1. The Challenge: Why We Built This

### Pain Points
*   **Administrative Overload:** Manual, paper-based attendance tracking consumes valuable time (~30 mins/service) that could be spent on ministry.
*   **Scattered Data:** Member information is likely decentralized or hard to access, making it difficult to track engagement or follow up effectively.
*   **Lack of Insights:** Without digital records, it's nearly impossible to analyze attendance trends, identify inactive members, or measure growth.
*   **Limited Visibility:** No centralized way to manage events or communicate them to the congregation and public.

### The Problem (from PRD)
The church needs a **centralized, intuitive platform** to:
1.  Eliminate paper-based processes.
2.  Create a single source of truth for member data.
3.  Enable data-driven decisions through reporting.
4.  Provide a scalable foundation for future growth.
